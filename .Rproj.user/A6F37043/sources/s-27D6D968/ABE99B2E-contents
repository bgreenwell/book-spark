# Distributed Machine Learning in R with Apache Spark: An Introduction Using sparklyr and rsparkling

What better way to learn the R interfaces to Apache Spark than to write a book about them?

What this book will cover:

* Part I

  - Introduction to Spark (what is Spark, installation, etc.)
  
  - Interfacing R with Spark via the `sparklyr` package (connectiong to Spark, data wrangling with `dplyr`, etc.)

  - Essentials of machine learning (cross-validation, target leakage, etc.)
  
* Part II

  - Machine learning in Spark via MLlib
  
  - Machine learning in Spark via the `rsparkling` package
