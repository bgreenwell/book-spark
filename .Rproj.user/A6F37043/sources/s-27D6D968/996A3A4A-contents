  - Introduction to Spark (what is Spark, installation, etc.)
  
  - Interfacing R with Spark via the `sparklyr` package (connectiong to Spark, data wrangling with `dplyr`, etc.)

  - Essentials of machine learning (cross-validation, target leakage, etc.)
  
* Part II

  - Machine learning in Spark via MLlib
  
  - Machine learning in Spark via the `rsparkling` package
